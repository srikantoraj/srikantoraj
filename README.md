## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Software Engineer (4+ years)** building **integration-heavy SaaS tools** and **workflow automations** using **JavaScript/TypeScript, APIs, and CI/CD**.  
I enjoy shipping reliable, secure systems — from **auth flows** and **webhook-style event handling** to **resilient error patterns** and maintainable platform integrations.

I also work with **agentic AI concepts (Agents, RAG)** and **MCP-style tool automation patterns**, focusing on grounded outputs, safe tool execution, and predictable integrations.

- 🌱 Focus: Product engineering, integrations, and automation
- 🥅 2025 Goal: Contribute more to Open Source projects
